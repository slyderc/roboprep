# Future Considerations

## Database Management
- Database backups and restoration functionality
- More advanced migration strategies for schema changes
- Potential cloud database support
- Performance optimizations for larger datasets
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Multi-User Support
- Authentication and authorization for multi-user environments
- User-specific settings, favorites, and recent prompts
- Optimized data refresh patterns for larger datasets

## Tag System Enhancements
- Server-side tag filtering for improved performance with large datasets
- Tag analytics to show most commonly used tags
- Tag suggestion system based on prompt content analysis
- Advanced filtering options:
  - Support for OR logic (show prompts with ANY selected tag)
  - Exclusion filtering (hide prompts with specific tags)
  - Filter persistence across sessions
  - Tag category grouping or hierarchical tags

## Category Improvements
- Custom category ordering (drag-and-drop reordering)
- Category color coding or icons
- Nested subcategories for more organizational flexibility
- Category-based permission system for multi-user environments

## Global Feature Considerations
- Auto variables in prompt templates like {{dow}} {{date}} {{weather=98144}} {{rss=https://www.stereofox.com/feed/}}
- True API for external program access for prompt/response database access
  - API key management
  - API wrapper library - migrate to OpenAPI
