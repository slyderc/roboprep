# Package Update Report

## Updated Packages
- Updated ESLint to version 8.57.1 (compatible with eslint-config-next)
- Updated glob to 10.3.10
- Updated rimraf to 5.0.5
- Added @eslint/config-array and @eslint/object-schema

## Remaining Issues

### Can't be resolved without breaking compatibility
1. **inflight@1.0.6** - Used by ESLint's dependency chain (eslint -> file-entry-cache -> flat-cache -> rimraf -> glob -> inflight)
   - This can't be updated without breaking ESLint compatibility
   - When ESLint is updated in the future, this should resolve

2. **node-domexception@1.0.0** - Used by OpenAI's dependency chain (openai -> formdata-node -> node-domexception)
   - This can't be updated without potentially breaking OpenAI functionality

## Next.js Runtime Warnings
The build shows Next.js Edge Runtime warnings, which are unrelated to the package deprecations. These are related to:
- JWT libraries used in auth.js
- bcryptjs
- APIs using cookies

These warnings don't prevent the app from working but indicate that certain routes can't be statically rendered.

## Recommendations for Future Updates
1. Monitor ESLint updates that support Next.js compatibility
2. Consider moving from bcryptjs to a more Edge-compatible authentication solution if you plan to deploy to Edge environments
3. Add a custom next.config.js setting to silence warnings for known edge runtime issues

```js
// Example next.config.js addition to suppress certain warnings
{
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
}
```
